utils for python



implementation of algorithms in python

To use visual of algorithms you will need to install pygame package (http://www.pygame.org).
Beware of pip installation of pygame, you will need Mercurial installed on your machine.
You can install it though pip with following command:
    pip install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame

If you using Windows and Python 3.4, I'd suggest you to get installer from:
        http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame

It's worked for me.
